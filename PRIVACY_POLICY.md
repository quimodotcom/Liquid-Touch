**Liquid Touch — Android Home Launcher**

*Effective Date: February 26, 2026*  
*Last Updated: February 26, 2026*

Thank you for using Liquid Touch ("the App"), an open-source Android home launcher developed by quimodotcom. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your information. Please read it carefully before using the App.

---

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

Liquid Touch is a local home launcher application. The App does not:

- Collect, store, or transmit any personal data
- Require account creation or registration
- Use analytics, crash reporting, or telemetry services
- Access your contacts, messages, call logs, or microphone
- Track your location
- Display advertisements
- Communicate with any remote servers operated by the developer

---

## 2. Permissions Used by the App

As a home launcher, Liquid Touch requires certain Android system permissions to function correctly. These permissions are used exclusively on-device and for the stated purposes:

**`READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` / `READ_MEDIA_*`**  
Used to display your wallpaper and animated lock screen cover art on your device. No files are uploaded or shared.

**`QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` / `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS`**  
Used to display and launch the apps installed on your device within the app drawer. No app usage data is transmitted externally.

**`SET_WALLPAPER`**  
Used to allow you to set wallpapers from within the launcher. All changes remain local to your device.

**`BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE` (if applicable)**  
Used only to enable gesture and touch interactions. No accessibility data is recorded or transmitted.

**`RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`**  
Used to restore the launcher as your home screen after your device restarts.

## 3. Open Source

Liquid Touch is open source and its full source code is available at [github.com/quimodotcom/Liquid-Touch](https://github.com/quimodotcom/Liquid-Touch). You are welcome to inspect the code to verify any of the claims in this Privacy Policy. The App is forked from the Fossify Home Launcher, which is similarly open source.

---

## 4. Third-Party Libraries

Liquid Touch uses the following open-source libraries. These libraries operate entirely on-device and do not independently collect or transmit data:

- **Android Liquid Glass (Backdrop) Library** by Kyant0 — provides the visual glass rendering effects
- **Fossify Home Launcher** — provides the core launcher functionality

---

## 5. Children's Privacy

Liquid Touch does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since no data is collected by the App at all, there is no special risk to children's privacy.

---

## 6. Changes to This Policy

If the App's data practices change in a future version (for example, if optional analytics or crash reporting are introduced), this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly and a new effective date will be posted. Continued use of the App after any update constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
