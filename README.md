# Liquid Touch

A *vibecoded* Liquid Glass home launcher for Android.

---

## Overview

Liquid Touch is a prototype Android home launcher built around the aesthetic of Apple's Liquid Glass design language — brought to Android through the [Android Liquid Glass (Backdrop) Library](https://github.com/Kyant0/AndroidLiquidGlass) by Kyant0, which served as the primary inspiration for this project.

The launcher is forked from the [Fossify Home Launcher](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Home), so many thanks to the entire Fossify team.

## A Note on the Code

Most of my projects are written entirely by hand — including some painfully handcrafted Unity games. This one is different. Having never built an Android or mobile app outside of Unity, I leaned heavily on AI assistance to get this off the ground. Roughly 99% of this codebase was vibecoded using various models (Claude Opus, Sonnet, Gemini, and others). This readme, however, is fully written by me.

I will be honest: even with AI, getting a functional app drawer proved genuinely difficult. That part was mine. The rest is a collaboration between me, a few language models, and a concerning number of YouTube tutorials.

This is very much a proof of concept. It is rough. It works enough to demonstrate the idea. I hope someone with more frontal cortex available will one day fork it and take it somewhere great.

## What's New

**Animated cover art now works on the lock screen.** This was a long time coming.

## Going Forward

From here, I intend to move away from AI-assisted development as much as possible. My goal is for this codebase to become predominantly human-written over time, using what exists now as a foundation. AI will only be brought back in as a last resort — when neither I nor anyone in the community can crack a particular problem.

Issues are open. Use them for bug reports or feature suggestions. I have made a personal commitment to address everything I reasonably can using my own knowledge and the existing code as a base.
