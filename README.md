# Liquid Touch: A Refreshing Twist on Android Home Launchers

Meet Liquid Touch, an Android home launcher inspired by Apple's sleek Liquid Glass style. This fresh take uses the [Android Liquid Glass (Backdrop) Library](https://github.com/Kyant0/AndroidLiquidGlass), courtesy of Kyant0. It's a standout project that not only draws from this innovative aesthetic but also utilizes the existing [Fossify Home Launcher](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Home) as its backbone. Kudos to all those original minds who laid down the groundwork!

## A Peek Behind the Curtain

Coding has always been a hands-on affair for me — just think about those Unity games I coded from scratch! Yet, this venture into app development was a bit different. Outside my usual playground of Unity, I dabbled with AI tools to piece together what you see today in Liquid Touch. Believe it or not, carving out a working app drawer was a true headache — but hey, that part's all me! The rest? Let's just say it's been a group effort with some AI input and an endless stream of YouTube tutorials.

## What's Hot Off the Press?

Animated cover art now works right on your lock screen — a feature many have eagerly awaited.

## Looking Ahead

Going forward, my plan is to steer clear of AI help as much as possible. I aim to evolve this codebase into something predominantly crafted by human hands, building on what we've started here. Sure, I might call on AI again if we hit a really tough snag — but only as a last resort.

## Call for Collaboration

Got bugs? Ideas? The floor is open — drop your suggestions or issues anytime. Rest assured, I'm here to tackle them using the arsenal of existing code and whatever grey matter I can muster.

## Dependencies

This project wouldn't be what it is without some key players:

- [Fossify Home Launcher](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Home) — the foundational backbone
- [Android Liquid Glass Library](https://github.com/Kyant0/AndroidLiquidGlass) — the style-defining work of Kyant0
