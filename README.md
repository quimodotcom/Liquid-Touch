# LiquidTouch

A *vibecoded* "Liquid Glass" android home launcher.

# This is **VIBECODED**
I feel kinda ashamed as most of my projects are fully coded by myself and my tiny ass brain, especially the poorly made Unity games. However, I've never made an android or mobile app in general without Unity. So this project is 99% vibecoded (this readme is written fully by me.)

But unfortunately, even with YouTube tutorials, I wasnt able to get this project off the ground. EVEN WITH AI, these fuckin models couldnt make an app drawer to save its server power. so yes, that was mine. and this project uses the Android Liquid Glass (Backdrop) library, which was the main inspiration behind this launcher.

I hope one day, someone can fork this project and fully redo it with the power of their frontal cortex. But until then, this is a very built prototype or proof of concept.

Issues are open for either suggestions or actual bugs experienced. I have made a pact with myself to try to fix/patch out all bugs or implement suggestions using this code and my existing knowledge as a starting base. AI WILL ONLY BE USED IF I CANNOT, for the life of me, IMPLEMENT IT FULLY OR A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY CANT EITHER.

Again while 99% of this project is vibecoded using various models (Opus, Sonnet, Gemini etc.), I would like the code to be mostly human coded from now on.

Many Thanks,
Evan (quiqqy/quimodotcom)

p.s. Thanks to the entirety of the Fossify Home Launcher Team and contributors. This code was originally forked from that launcher and therefore I have kept all of you lovely fellows in the contributors of this project too!

NOW WITH WORKING ANIMATED COVER ART FOR THE LOCK SCREEN!!!
